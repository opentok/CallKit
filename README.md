# CallKit Integration with OpenTok
A sample app to demonstrate how to integrate CallKit into OpenTok iOS SDK. This sample app is built based on the [SpeakerBox](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/Speakerbox/Introduction/Intro.html) app from WWDC 2016

### Install the project files

Use CocoaPods to install the project files and dependencies.

1. Install CocoaPods as described in [CocoaPods Getting Started](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started).
1. In Terminal, `cd` to your project directory and type `pod install`. (Sometimes, `pod update` is magical)
1. Reopen your project in Xcode using the new `*.xcworkspace` file.


### Configure and build the app

Configure the sample app code. Then, build and run the app.

1. The application **requires** values for **API Key**, **Session ID**, and **Token**. In the sample, you can get these values at the [OpenTok Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.tokbox.com/). For production deployment, you must generate the **Session ID** and **Token** values using one of the [OpenTok Server SDKs](https://tokbox.com/developer/sdks/server/).

1. Replace the following empty strings with the corresponding **API Key**, **Session ID**, and **Token** values in `AppDelegate.swift`:
    ```swift
      let apiKey = ""
      let sessionId = ""
      let token = ""
    ```

1. Use Xcode to build and run the app on an iOS simulator or device.

### Exploring

![demo](./demo.png)

  1. **Make a call**: 

The iOS system boosts the call priority of the app. Then, the app starts publishing to OpenTok platform. You won't notice any differences until you go to the home screen. Two ways to verify:
  - A badge in home screen indicating an ongoing VoIP call.
  - An incoming native phone call will not interrupt the current VoIP call, instead it shows the option menu.

  2. **Simulate a call**

An incoming call screen appears. Upon acceptance, the iOS system opens the app and boosts the call priority. Then, the app starts publishing to OpenTok platform.

  3. **Simulate Call after 3s(Background)** (After clicking the button, please lock your cell phone to test this scenario.)

The system wakes up your cell phone by making a native calling screen with a slider bar at the bottom. Upon acceptance, the iOS system stays at the current screen and boosts the call priority. Then, the app (which runs in the background during that time) starts publishing to the OpenTok platform.
